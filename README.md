# CitySim Project - Browser-Based City Simulation Game

## Overview
CitySim is a browser-based city simulation game where you take on the role of a city planner and manager. Design and build your dream city, manage resources, attract citizens, and strive to create a thriving metropolis while keeping your populace happy and your finances in check.

## How to Play

### Goal
The primary goal is to grow your city by zoning residential, commercial, and industrial areas, providing essential services like power and roads, and managing the city's economy and environment. Success is measured by population growth, citizen happiness, and financial stability.

### UI Elements

*   **Toolbar:** Located at the top/bottom/side (developer to specify final location) of the screen, the toolbar provides quick access to essential tools:
    *   **Select Tool:** Allows you to inspect buildings and tiles.
    *   **Bulldoze Tool:** Demolish existing structures.
    *   **Road Tool:** Build roads to connect your city. Roads are essential for buildings to function.
    *   **Residential Zone Tool:** Zone areas for housing. Attracts citizens to your city.
    *   **Commercial Zone Tool:** Zone areas for shops and services. Provides jobs and goods.
    *   **Industrial Zone Tool:** Zone areas for factories and manufacturing. Provides jobs but can cause pollution.
    *   **Power Plant Tool:** Build power plants to generate electricity for your city.
    *   **Power Line Tool:** Construct power lines to distribute electricity from power plants to buildings.

*   **Stats Display (Top Bar):** This bar provides real-time information about your city:
    *   **Revenue:** Your city's current funds. Building and maintenance cost money. Taxes generate revenue.
    *   **Population:** The total number of citizens living in your city.
    *   **Happiness:** The overall happiness level of your citizens. Low happiness can lead to citizens leaving or slower growth. Influenced by taxes, pollution, and services.
    *   **Pollution:** The level of pollution in your city, primarily generated by industrial zones and traffic. High pollution negatively impacts happiness and health.
    *   **Lifespan:** The average lifespan of your citizens, influenced by happiness and pollution.
    *   **Date:** The current in-game date.

*   **Pause Button:** Allows you to pause or resume the simulation time. Useful for planning without the pressure of ongoing events.

*   **Save/Load Buttons:**
    *   **Save Game:** Saves your current city progress to your browser's local storage.
    *   **Load Game:** Loads a previously saved game from local storage. *Warning: Loading will overwrite any unsaved progress.*

### Core Mechanics

*   **Placing Buildings:**
    1.  Select a building tool (e.g., Residential Zone, Road) from the toolbar.
    2.  Click on an empty tile on the game map to place the selected building/zone.
    3.  Each building or zone has an initial construction cost, which will be deducted from your revenue.
    4.  Buildings also have ongoing maintenance costs.

*   **Simulation:** The game simulates various aspects of city life over time:
    *   **Revenue & Economy:** Taxes are collected from residents and businesses. Maintenance costs for buildings and services are deducted.
    *   **Population Growth:** Residential zones with adequate services and happiness will attract new citizens.
    *   **Happiness:** Affected by factors like tax rates, pollution levels, availability of jobs, and potentially future services like parks, police, etc.
    *   **Pollution:** Generated by industrial zones, power plants, and traffic. Can be mitigated by strategic placement and future green technologies.
    *   **Lifespan:** A measure of citizen health, influenced by overall city conditions.

*   **Importance of Roads:** Most buildings require road access to function correctly. Citizens need roads to get to jobs, and services need them to operate. (This mechanic is implicitly handled by building placement logic).

*   **Power Management:** Buildings require power to operate. Power plants generate electricity, which is distributed through power lines. Ensure your power grid reaches all developed areas.

*   **Game Over:** The game can end if your city's revenue drops significantly below zero, leading to bankruptcy. Strive to maintain a positive cash flow!

## Setup Instructions

To run CitySim locally, you'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm installed.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd city-sim-project
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start a local development server (usually on `http://localhost:5173` or a similar port). Open this URL in your web browser to play the game.

## Technologies Used
*   JavaScript (ES6 Modules)
*   Three.js for 3D rendering
*   Vite for the development environment and build process

## Future Enhancements (Ideas)
*   More building types (e.g., parks, schools, police stations, fire stations).
*   Advanced services (water, waste management).
*   Traffic simulation.
*   Events and disasters.
*   Policy controls (tax rates, service funding).
*   More detailed citizen simulation and feedback.
*   Improved UI/UX and visual feedback.
